# Development Plan - Fantrax Value Hunter

**Project**: Fantrax Fantasy Football Value Optimization System  
**Start Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Season Start**: August 15, 2025 (tomorrow!)  

---

## 🎯 **Project Status: PROPER TOOL DEVELOPMENT** 🔧🚀

### **STRATEGY PIVOT**: Skip Game Week 1, Build Right

**Decision**: Focus on building a comprehensive, accurate tool rather than rushing an MVP with known flaws.

### Technical Foundation Complete
- ✅ **API Access**: All 633 players accessible via pagination breakthrough
- ✅ **Authentication**: Working session management with exported cookies
- ✅ **Data Structure**: Complete understanding of player data format
- ✅ **Position Mapping**: All 4 positions properly categorized (G:74, D:213, M:232, F:114)

### Critical Issues Identified
- 🚨 **Value Calculation Flaw**: Current system uses season totals, not per-game/per-minute
- 🚨 **No Context Data**: Missing minutes played, injury status, recent form
- 🚨 **Gems Finder Risk**: Could recommend injured/benched players
- 🚨 **No Dashboard**: Need proper UI for decision making

**Result**: MVP would be unreliable for actual league play. Better to build properly.
