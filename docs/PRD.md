## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Create a comprehensive fantasy football analytics platform for the "Its Coming Home" Fantrax league, featuring accurate value analysis, context-aware player recommendations, and an interactive web dashboard for optimal $100 salary cap lineups each game week.

**Strategic Pivot**: Skip Game Week 1 to build a reliable, accurate system rather than rushing a flawed MVP.

### 1.2 Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Generate lineups that consistently outperform league average by 15%+
- **Secondary**: Identify 2-3 "hidden gems" per week (low ownership, high value players)
- **Tertiary**: Achieve top 3 league finish through superior player selection
