# Form Data Infrastructure - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Sprint 5 implemented a complete form data infrastructure for weekly Fantrax CSV uploads, enabling dynamic form multiplier calculations based on recent player performance.

## System Architecture

### Database Structure
```sql
-- Form data table
CREATE TABLE player_form (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id VARCHAR(10) REFERENCES players(id),
    gameweek INTEGER NOT NULL,
    points DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(player_id, gameweek)
);
```

### Configuration Parameters
Located in `config/system_parameters.json`:
```json
{
  "form_calculation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "lookback_period": 3,
    "baseline_switchover_gameweek": 10,
    "minimum_games_for_form": 3,
    "disabled_multiplier": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Form Calculation Logic

### Algorithm (app.py:89-128)
1. **Before GW10**: Uses previous season baseline + form adjustment
2. **After GW10**: Uses current season average + form adjustment
3. **Minimum games**: Requires 3 games for form calculation, otherwise returns 1.0x
4. **Weighted calculation**: Uses configurable weights (default: 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 for last 3 games)
5. **Multiplier constraints**: Capped between 0.5x and 1.5x

### Form Multiplier Formula
```python
# Weighted average of recent games
weights = [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]  # Last 3 games
weighted_sum = sum(points[i] * weights[i] for i in range(min(3, len(points))))
form_multiplier = clamp(weighted_sum / total_weight, 0.5, 1.5)
```

## Import Workflow

### 1. API Endpoint: `/api/import-form-data`
**Location**: `src/app.py:1269-1389`

**Method**: POST  
**Content-Type**: multipart/form-data

**Parameters**:
- `csv_file`: Fantrax CSV export file
- `gameweek`: Target gameweek number (integer)

### 2. Expected CSV Format
Standard Fantrax export with columns:
- `ID`: Player ID (format: `*player_id*` - asterisks are stripped)
- `Player`: Player name (for validation)
- `FPts`: Fantasy points for the gameweek

### 3. Import Process
1. **File validation**: Checks CSV format and required columns
2. **Player ID extraction**: Strips asterisks from ID field
3. **Auto-add new players**: Automatically adds missing players to database with team/position info
4. **Data insertion**: Uses `ON CONFLICT` to handle duplicate gameweeks
5. **System update**: Enables form calculations in system parameters

### 4. Usage Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "csv_file=@/path/to/fantrax-export.csv" \
  -F "gameweek=1" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/import-form-data
```

## Current Status (August 18, 2025)

### âœ… Completed Features (Sprint 5 Complete)
- [x] Database schema and table creation
- [x] Form calculation algorithm with weighted averages  
- [x] CSV import API endpoint with error handling
- [x] Integration with true value calculations
- [x] System parameter configuration
- [x] Data validation and conflict resolution
- [x] Auto-add new players functionality
- [x] Web-based upload UI with step-by-step instructions
- [x] Dashboard navigation integration

### âœ… Testing Results
- **Test file**: `c:/Users/halvo/Downloads/Fantrax-Players-Its Coming Home (8).csv`
- **Initial import success**: 608/619 players (98.2% success rate)
- **Missing players**: 11 players from recent transfers - all manually added
- **Final success rate**: 100% with auto-add feature
- **Form records**: 1,216 total (608 players Ã— 2 gameweeks)
- **Calculations**: Working correctly (1.0x multipliers with <3 games as expected)

### âœ… Enhanced Features (August 18, 2025)

#### Auto-Add New Players
**Feature**: Automatically adds missing players to database during import  
**Benefit**: Handles transfer window changes seamlessly  
**Implementation**: `src/app.py:1347-1362`  
**Data extracted**: Player ID, name, team, position from CSV  

Example auto-add logic:
```python
if player_id not in existing_player_ids:
    # Auto-add new player to database
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO players (id, name, team, position, updated_at, minutes, xg90, xa90, xgi90, last_understat_update)
        VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, NOW(), %s, %s, %s, %s, NOW())
    """, (player_id, player_name, team, position, 0, 0.000, 0.000, 0.000))
    
    new_players_added.append(f"{player_name} ({team}, {position})")
```

**Result**: Now achieves 100% import success rate instead of 98.2%

#### Upload UI Interface
**Feature**: Complete web-based form upload interface  
**Implementation**: `templates/form_upload.html` + route `/form-upload`  
**Key features**:
- Step-by-step instructions with Fantrax navigation link
- Drag-and-drop CSV upload with validation
- Real-time progress feedback and statistics display
- Automatic gameweek number input with validation
- Dashboard navigation button integration

**UI Components**:
- Direct link to Fantrax players page for CSV export
- Clear instructions for weekly upload workflow
- Success/error feedback with detailed statistics
- New players added notification system
- Safe duplicate upload handling information

#### Dashboard Integration
**Feature**: One-click navigation from main dashboard to form upload
**Implementation**: `templates/dashboard.html:190-192`
**Button**: "ðŸ“Š Upload Form Data" opens in new tab
**Location**: Action buttons section alongside other CSV import tools

#### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated imports**: Direct Fantrax API integration (requires wrapper completion)
2. **Data validation dashboard**: Visual checks for form data quality
3. **Historical data backfill**: Import previous season data for baseline calculations
4. **Player matching improvements**: Better ID synchronization between systems

## Weekly Workflow

### For System Administrator
1. **After gameweek ends** (Sunday/Monday):
   - Navigate to dashboard at `http://localhost:5000/`
   - Click "ðŸ“Š Upload Form Data" button to open form upload page
   - Follow the direct link to Fantrax players page
   - Export current gameweek data as CSV with all players visible

2. **Upload data** (Monday/Tuesday):
   **Via Web Interface (Recommended)**:
   - Use the upload form at `/form-upload`
   - Select CSV file and enter gameweek number
   - Click "Upload Form Data" and review results
   - Verify import statistics and any new players added
   
   **Via Command Line (Alternative)**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -F "csv_file=@Fantrax-Players-Export.csv" \
     -F "gameweek=X" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/import-form-data
   ```

3. **Verify import**:
   - Review upload success page showing import statistics
   - Check for any new players automatically added
   - Confirm 100% import success rate achieved
   - Verify form calculations update in main dashboard

4. **Transfer decisions** (before Wednesday price changes):
   - Return to main dashboard via back link
   - Use updated form multipliers in True Value rankings
   - Apply parameter adjustments if needed
   - Make transfer decisions based on enhanced value calculations

## Integration Points

### True Value Formula Enhancement
Form multipliers are integrated into the main value calculation:
```python
# In candidate selection logic
true_value = ppg * fixture_multiplier * form_multiplier * starter_multiplier
```

### System Parameters Dashboard
Form calculation parameters can be adjusted via the admin dashboard without code changes.
