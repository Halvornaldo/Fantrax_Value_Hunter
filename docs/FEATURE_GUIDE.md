> **Note**: The dashboard features described below reflect the current v1.0 system. Sprint 2's advanced calculations (EWMA form, dynamic blending, normalized xGI) are ready but will be integrated in Sprint 4 for seamless user experience.

## Parameter Controls Panel

All features can be configured through the Parameter Controls panel on the left side of the dashboard.

### Form Calculation

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on recent performance versus season average

**Current Dashboard (v1.0)**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle form calculation
- **Lookback Period**: 3 or 5 games (dropdown)
- **Minimum Games**: Minimum games required for form calculation (default: 3)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to switch from historical to current data (default: 10)
- **Form Strength**: How much form affects True Value (slider, default: 1.00x)

**v1.0 Technical Implementation**:
- **Before GW10**: Uses 2024-25 season baseline + form adjustment
- **After GW10**: Uses current season average + form adjustment
- **Weighted Calculation**: Recent games weighted 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 for last 3 games
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x

**Sprint 2 Enhancement (API Only)**:
- **EWMA Calculation**: Exponential Weighted Moving Average with Î±=0.87
- **Exponential Decay**: Recent games weighted exponentially higher (Î±^0, Î±^1, Î±^2...)
- **Dynamic Baseline**: Uses blended PPG instead of fixed baseline
- **5-Game Half-Life**: Î±=0.87 provides 5-game half-life for form decay
- **Enhanced Caps**: [0.5, 2.0] range for more responsive form calculation

**How It Works**:
- v1.0: Fixed weighted average vs historical/current baseline
- v2.0: Sophisticated exponential decay with smooth baseline transition
- Form data stored in `player_form` table with weekly Fantrax CSV uploads
- v2.0 available via `/api/calculate-values-v2` endpoint

### Odds-Based Fixture Difficulty

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on upcoming fixture difficulty using real betting odds from OddsPortal.com

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle fixture difficulty
- **Preset Levels**: Conservative (Â±10%), Balanced (Â±20%), Aggressive (Â±30%), or Custom
- **Multiplier Strength**: How much fixture difficulty affects True Value (0.1-0.5 range)
- **Position Weights**: Different impact by position
  - Goalkeepers: 110% (benefit more from easy fixtures - save opportunities)
  - Defenders: 120% (maximum impact - clean sheet dependency)
  - Midfielders: 100% (baseline - balanced offensive/defensive)
  - Forwards: 105% (slight bonus - scoring vs weaker defenses)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **21-Point Scale**: Converts betting odds to difficulty scores (-10 to +10)
- **Calculation**: difficulty = (opponent_win_probability - 0.5) Ã— 20
- **Final Multiplier**: 1.0 + (difficulty/10) Ã— strength Ã— position_weight
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x
- **Performance**: Optimized caching reduces calculation time from 90s to 46s

**Example**:
- Arsenal vs Leeds: Leeds has 7.50 odds (13% win probability)
- Arsenal difficulty vs Leeds: (0.13 - 0.5) Ã— 20 = -7.4
- Arsenal defender multiplier: 1.0 + (-7.4/10) Ã— 0.2 Ã— 1.2 = 1.178x

### Starter Predictions

**Purpose**: Penalizes players unlikely to start based on predicted lineups

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle starter predictions
- **Auto Rotation Penalty**: Penalty for rotation-risk players (default: 0.65x)
- **Force Bench Penalty**: Penalty for likely benched players (default: 0.60x)

**How It Works**:
- CSV import identifies predicted starters (receive 1.0x multiplier)
- Non-starters receive penalty multiplier based on slider values
- Manual overrides can force specific multiplier values
- Helps avoid players likely to be rested or benched

**Multiplier Values**:
- **Starter**: 1.0x (predicted to start)
- **Rotation Risk**: Uses "Auto Rotation Penalty" slider value (default: 0.65x)
- **Bench**: Uses "Force Bench Penalty" slider value (default: 0.60x)  
- **Out**: 0.0x (injured/suspended)

### xGI Integration (Understat)

**Purpose**: Incorporates Expected Goals Involvement (xG + xA) data from Understat

**Current Dashboard (v1.0)**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle xGI integration
- **Multiplier Mode**: How xGI affects True Value
  - Direct: xGI90 Ã— strength
  - Adjusted: 1 + (xGI90 Ã— strength)  
  - Capped: Limited range (0.5 - 1.5)
- **Multiplier Strength**: xGI impact factor (default: 1.0)
- **Sync Button**: Manually sync with Understat data

**Sprint 2 Enhancement (API Only)**:
- **Normalized xGI**: Ratio-based calculation (current_xGI90 / baseline_xGI90)
- **Historical Baselines**: Uses 2024/25 season data for proper comparison
- **Position-Specific Logic**:
  - **Goalkeepers**: xGI disabled (not relevant)
  - **Defenders**: 60% impact reduction (less xGI relevance)
  - **Midfielders/Forwards**: Full impact (100%)
- **Enhanced Range**: [0.4, 2.5] multiplier caps
- **Data Integration**: 335 players with historical baselines from extract_baseline_xgi.py

**How It Works**:
- v1.0: Direct/adjusted/capped modes using raw xGI90 values
- v2.0: Normalized ratio comparing current vs historical performance
- Baseline data extracted from Understat 2024/25 season
- Position awareness ensures realistic impact per player role
- Accounts for underlying performance metrics
- Helps identify undervalued attacking players

### Blender Display

**Purpose**: Configures how games played data is displayed and when to switch between historical/current data

**Current Dashboard (v1.0)**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Always enabled (checkbox for future use)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to start blending historical + current data (default: 10)
- **Transition Period End**: When to switch from blended to current-only (default: 15)  
- **Show Historical Data**: Whether to display 2024-25 season data (default: checked)

**v1.0 Implementation**:
- **Gameweeks 1-10**: Shows "38 (24-25)" format (historical data only)
  - Baseline = Previous Season PPG
  - Form = Recent Games / Historical Baseline
- **Gameweeks 11-15**: Shows "38+2" format (historical + current games)
  - Linear transition from historical to current baseline
- **Gameweeks 16+**: Shows "5" format (current season only)
  - Baseline = Current Season PPG only

**Sprint 2 Enhancement (API Only)**:
- **Dynamic PPG Blending**: Smooth mathematical transition using `w_current = min(1, (N-1)/(K-1))`
- **Configurable Adaptation**: Full adaptation gameweek (default: 16) 
- **Enhanced Formula**: `blended_ppg = w_current Ã— current_ppg + w_historical Ã— historical_ppg`
- **Seamless Transition**: No hard cutoffs, gradual weight shift
- **Metadata Tracking**: Includes blending weights and adaptation progress in API response

**How It Works**:
- v1.0: Hard switches between historical/current baselines at fixed gameweeks
- v2.0: Mathematical blending with configurable parameters and smooth transitions
- Display format remains consistent for user familiarity
- Provides context for sample size reliability and calculation methodology
