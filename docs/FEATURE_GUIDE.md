# Dashboard Features Guide

## Overview
The Fantrax Value Hunter dashboard provides configurable analytics for Premier League fantasy football players, combining multiple data sources to calculate optimized "True Value" ratings.

## Formula Optimization v2.0 Status (2025-08-21)

**Current Status**: Sprint 1 Complete - Foundation implemented but not yet live in dashboard
- âœ… **Core Formula Fixed**: True Value now separate from price (calculation engine only)
- âœ… **Exponential Fixture Calculation**: Implemented base^(-difficulty) transformation
- âœ… **Multiplier Cap System**: Prevents extreme outliers in calculations
- ðŸ”„ **Dashboard Integration**: Will be added in Sprint 4
- ðŸ”„ **Advanced Features**: EWMA form, dynamic blending pending Sprint 2

**Current Dashboard**: Still shows v1.0 calculations (mixed price/prediction formula)
**Testing**: v2.0 calculations available via API endpoints (`/api/calculate-values-v2`)

> **Note**: The dashboard features described below reflect the current v1.0 system. v2.0 improvements will be integrated into the dashboard in future sprints while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Parameter Controls Panel

All features can be configured through the Parameter Controls panel on the left side of the dashboard.

### Form Calculation

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on recent performance versus season average

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle form calculation
- **Lookback Period**: 3 or 5 games (dropdown)
- **Minimum Games**: Minimum games required for form calculation (default: 3)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to switch from historical to current data (default: 10)
- **Form Strength**: How much form affects True Value (slider, default: 1.00x)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Before GW10**: Uses 2024-25 season baseline + form adjustment
- **After GW10**: Uses current season average + form adjustment
- **Weighted Calculation**: Recent games weighted 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 for last 3 games
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x
- **Minimum Threshold**: Requires 3+ games for calculation, otherwise returns 1.0x

**How It Works**:
- Calculates weighted average of recent games vs season performance
- Form data stored in `player_form` table with weekly Fantrax CSV uploads
- Earlier in season: Uses 2024-25 historical data as baseline
- Later in season: Uses current season form data
- Higher form strength = bigger impact on True Value

### Odds-Based Fixture Difficulty

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on upcoming fixture difficulty using real betting odds from OddsPortal.com

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle fixture difficulty
- **Preset Levels**: Conservative (Â±10%), Balanced (Â±20%), Aggressive (Â±30%), or Custom
- **Multiplier Strength**: How much fixture difficulty affects True Value (0.1-0.5 range)
- **Position Weights**: Different impact by position
  - Goalkeepers: 110% (benefit more from easy fixtures - save opportunities)
  - Defenders: 120% (maximum impact - clean sheet dependency)
  - Midfielders: 100% (baseline - balanced offensive/defensive)
  - Forwards: 105% (slight bonus - scoring vs weaker defenses)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **21-Point Scale**: Converts betting odds to difficulty scores (-10 to +10)
- **Calculation**: difficulty = (opponent_win_probability - 0.5) Ã— 20
- **Final Multiplier**: 1.0 + (difficulty/10) Ã— strength Ã— position_weight
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x
- **Performance**: Optimized caching reduces calculation time from 90s to 46s

**Example**:
- Arsenal vs Leeds: Leeds has 7.50 odds (13% win probability)
- Arsenal difficulty vs Leeds: (0.13 - 0.5) Ã— 20 = -7.4
- Arsenal defender multiplier: 1.0 + (-7.4/10) Ã— 0.2 Ã— 1.2 = 1.178x

### Starter Predictions

**Purpose**: Penalizes players unlikely to start based on predicted lineups

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle starter predictions
- **Auto Rotation Penalty**: Penalty for rotation-risk players (default: 0.65x)
- **Force Bench Penalty**: Penalty for likely benched players (default: 0.60x)

**How It Works**:
- CSV import identifies predicted starters (receive 1.0x multiplier)
- Non-starters receive penalty multiplier based on slider values
- Manual overrides can force specific multiplier values
- Helps avoid players likely to be rested or benched

**Multiplier Values**:
- **Starter**: 1.0x (predicted to start)
- **Rotation Risk**: Uses "Auto Rotation Penalty" slider value (default: 0.65x)
- **Bench**: Uses "Force Bench Penalty" slider value (default: 0.60x)  
- **Out**: 0.0x (injured/suspended)

### xGI Integration (Understat)

**Purpose**: Incorporates Expected Goals Involvement (xG + xA) data from Understat

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle xGI integration
- **Multiplier Mode**: How xGI affects True Value
  - Direct: xGI90 Ã— strength
  - Adjusted: 1 + (xGI90 Ã— strength)  
  - Capped: Limited range (0.5 - 1.5)
- **Multiplier Strength**: xGI impact factor (default: 1.0)
- **Sync Button**: Manually sync with Understat data

**How It Works**:
- Higher xGI90 values = higher multipliers
- Accounts for underlying performance metrics
- Helps identify undervalued attacking players

### Blender Display

**Purpose**: Configures how games played data is displayed and when to switch between historical/current data

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Always enabled (checkbox for future use)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to start blending historical + current data (default: 10)
- **Transition Period End**: When to switch from blended to current-only (default: 15)  
- **Show Historical Data**: Whether to display 2024-25 season data (default: checked)

**How It Works**:
- **Gameweeks 1-10**: Shows "38 (24-25)" format (historical data only)
  - Baseline = Previous Season PPG
  - Form = Recent Games / Historical Baseline
- **Gameweeks 11-15**: Shows "38+2" format (historical + current games)
  - Progressive Blending: Weighted Average(Historical PPG, Current Season PPG)
  - Weighting transitions from 100% historical to 0% historical linearly
  - Example GW13: ~60% historical + 40% current season baseline
- **Gameweeks 16+**: Shows "5" format (current season only)
  - Baseline = Current Season PPG only
  - Form = Recent Games / Current Season Baseline
- Provides context for sample size reliability and calculation methodology
