# Dashboard Features Guide

## Overview
The Fantrax Value Hunter dashboard provides configurable analytics for Premier League fantasy football players, combining multiple data sources to calculate optimized "True Value" ratings.

## Parameter Controls Panel

All features can be configured through the Parameter Controls panel on the left side of the dashboard.

### Form Calculation

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on recent performance versus season average

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle form calculation
- **Lookback Period**: 3 or 5 games (dropdown)
- **Minimum Games**: Minimum games required for form calculation (default: 3)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to switch from historical to current data (default: 10)
- **Form Strength**: How much form affects True Value (slider, default: 1.00x)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Before GW10**: Uses 2024-25 season baseline + form adjustment
- **After GW10**: Uses current season average + form adjustment
- **Weighted Calculation**: Recent games weighted 0.5, 0.3, 0.2 for last 3 games
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x
- **Minimum Threshold**: Requires 3+ games for calculation, otherwise returns 1.0x

**How It Works**:
- Calculates weighted average of recent games vs season performance
- Form data stored in `player_form` table with weekly Fantrax CSV uploads
- Earlier in season: Uses 2024-25 historical data as baseline
- Later in season: Uses current season form data
- Higher form strength = bigger impact on True Value

### Odds-Based Fixture Difficulty

**Purpose**: Adjusts player values based on upcoming fixture difficulty using real betting odds from OddsPortal.com

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle fixture difficulty
- **Preset Levels**: Conservative (Â±10%), Balanced (Â±20%), Aggressive (Â±30%), or Custom
- **Multiplier Strength**: How much fixture difficulty affects True Value (0.1-0.5 range)
- **Position Weights**: Different impact by position
  - Goalkeepers: 110% (benefit more from easy fixtures - save opportunities)
  - Defenders: 120% (maximum impact - clean sheet dependency)
  - Midfielders: 100% (baseline - balanced offensive/defensive)
  - Forwards: 105% (slight bonus - scoring vs weaker defenses)

**Technical Implementation**:
- **21-Point Scale**: Converts betting odds to difficulty scores (-10 to +10)
- **Calculation**: difficulty = (opponent_win_probability - 0.5) Ã— 20
- **Final Multiplier**: 1.0 + (difficulty/10) Ã— strength Ã— position_weight
- **Constraints**: Multipliers capped between 0.5x and 1.5x
- **Performance**: Optimized caching reduces calculation time from 90s to 46s

**Example**:
- Arsenal vs Leeds: Leeds has 7.50 odds (13% win probability)
- Arsenal difficulty vs Leeds: (0.13 - 0.5) Ã— 20 = -7.4
- Arsenal defender multiplier: 1.0 + (-7.4/10) Ã— 0.2 Ã— 1.2 = 1.178x

### Starter Predictions

**Purpose**: Penalizes players unlikely to start based on predicted lineups

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle starter predictions
- **Auto Rotation Penalty**: Penalty for rotation-risk players (default: 0.65x)
- **Force Bench Penalty**: Penalty for likely benched players (default: 0.60x)

**How It Works**:
- CSV import identifies predicted starters
- Non-starters receive rotation penalty multiplier
- Helps avoid players likely to be rested or benched

### xGI Integration (Understat)

**Purpose**: Incorporates Expected Goals Involvement (xG + xA) data from Understat

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Checkbox to toggle xGI integration
- **Multiplier Mode**: How xGI affects True Value
  - Direct: xGI90 Ã— strength
  - Adjusted: 1 + (xGI90 Ã— strength)  
  - Capped: Limited range (0.5 - 1.5)
- **Multiplier Strength**: xGI impact factor (default: 1.0)
- **Sync Button**: Manually sync with Understat data

**How It Works**:
- Higher xGI90 values = higher multipliers
- Accounts for underlying performance metrics
- Helps identify undervalued attacking players

### Games Display

**Purpose**: Configures how games played data is displayed and when to switch between historical/current data

**Controls**:
- **Enable/Disable**: Always enabled (checkbox for future use)
- **Baseline Switchover Gameweek**: When to start blending historical + current data (default: 10)
- **Transition Period End**: When to switch from blended to current-only (default: 15)  
- **Show Historical Data**: Whether to display 2024-25 season data (default: checked)

**How It Works**:
- **Gameweeks 1-10**: Shows "38 (24-25)" format (historical data only)
- **Gameweeks 11-15**: Shows "38+2" format (historical + current games)
- **Gameweeks 16+**: Shows "5" format (current season only)
- Provides context for sample size reliability

## Player Table

### Columns Explained

- **Name**: Player name with tooltip information
- **Team**: Three-letter team code
- **Pos**: Position (G/D/M/F)
- **Price**: Current Fantrax price
- **PPG**: Points per game (current or blended based on gameweek)
- **PP$**: Points per dollar (PPG Ã· Price) - value indicator

## Data Import Workflows

### Weekly Form Data Import

1. Click "ðŸ“Š Upload Form Data" button
2. Enter gameweek number (e.g., "2" for Week 2)
3. Upload Fantrax CSV export
4. System processes points and updates metrics
5. True Values recalculated automatically

## True Value Calculation

**Base Formula**: 
```
True Value = PPG Ã— Form Multiplier Ã— Fixture Multiplier Ã— Starter Multiplier Ã— xGI Multiplier
```

**Example**:
- Player PPG: 8.0
- Form Multiplier: 1.2x (good recent form)
- Fixture Multiplier: 1.1x (easy fixture)
- Starter Multiplier: 1.0x (predicted starter)
- xGI Multiplier: 1.3x (high xGI)
- **True Value**: 8.0 Ã— 1.2 Ã— 1.1 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.3 = **13.73**
