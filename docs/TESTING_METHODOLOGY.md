# Testing Methodology - Fantrax Value Hunter
**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Purpose**: Systematic approach to validate each component

---

## 🎯 **Core Development Principles**

### **Scope Discipline**
- ✅ **Stick to defined features**: No feature creep beyond documented requirements
- ✅ **One feature at a time**: Complete and test before moving to next
- ✅ **Document changes**: Update specs if scope adjustments are needed
- ❌ **No "just one more thing"**: Resist adding unplanned features

### **Quality First Approach**  
- 🧪 **Test before integrate**: Every component validated independently
- 📊 **Data validation**: Cross-check against known Fantrax values
- 🔄 **Incremental building**: Small steps, steady progress
- 🎯 **End-to-end validation**: Full workflow testing before release

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy by Component**

### **1. Value Calculation Engine**
**What to Test:**
- Points per game vs season total calculations
- Edge cases (injured players, minimal games)
- Mathematical accuracy of formulas

**Test Data:**
```python
# Known player examples for validation
test_cases = [
    {"name": "Haaland", "expected_ppg": 8.5, "games": 30},
    {"name": "Injured_Player", "expected_ppg": 0, "games": 0}, 
    {"name": "Substitute", "expected_ppg": 3.2, "minutes": 450}
]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ PPG calculations match manual verification
- ✅ Handles edge cases without errors
- ✅ Results consistent across runs

### **2. Player Data Pipeline**
**What to Test:**
- API pagination (all 633 players retrieved)
- Data parsing accuracy (no missing fields)
- Position categorization correctness

**Validation Steps:**
1. **Count verification**: Confirm 633 total players
2. **Position distribution**: G:74, D:213, M:232, F:114
3. **Sample data checks**: Manually verify 10 random players

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All pages fetched successfully
- ✅ No data corruption or missing values
- ✅ Position mapping 100% accurate

### **3. Lineup Generation**
**What to Test:**
- Budget constraint compliance ($100 max)
- Position requirements (1G, 3-5D, 3-5M, 1-3F)
- Value optimization logic

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Budget stress test**: Try with $50, $75, $100 budgets
- **Position edge cases**: Minimum and maximum position counts
- **No valid solution**: What happens if constraints impossible?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Never exceeds $100 budget
- ✅ Always meets position requirements
- ✅ Graceful handling of impossible constraints

### **4. Web Dashboard** 
**What to Test:**
- Data loading and display accuracy
- Filter functionality (position, price, ownership)
- Lineup builder drag-and-drop

**Testing Process:**
1. **Component isolation**: Test table, filters, builder separately
2. **Data integrity**: Verify displayed values match source
3. **User interactions**: Click, sort, filter all work correctly

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All 633 players display correctly
- ✅ Filters produce expected results
- ✅ Lineup builder enforces constraints

## 📊 **Validation Data Sources**

### **Ground Truth Comparisons**
- **Fantrax Website**: Manual spot-checks against live data
- **Premier League Official**: Player stats verification
- **Fantasy Communities**: Sanity check recommendations

### **Test Data Sets**
- **Sample Players**: 20 known players across all positions
- **Edge Cases**: Injured, transferred, rarely-played players  
- **Historical Data**: Previous game week results for accuracy

### **Automated Checks**
```python
def validate_lineup(lineup, budget=100):
    """Automated lineup validation"""
    assert len(lineup) == 11, "Must have 11 players"
    assert sum(p['salary'] for p in lineup) <= budget, "Budget exceeded"
    
    positions = [p['position'] for p in lineup]
    assert positions.count('G') == 1, "Need exactly 1 goalkeeper"
    assert 3 <= positions.count('D') <= 5, "Need 3-5 defenders"
    assert 3 <= positions.count('M') <= 5, "Need 3-5 midfielders"
    assert 1 <= positions.count('F') <= 3, "Need 1-3 forwards"
    
    return True
```

## 🔄 **Testing Workflow**

### **Per Feature Development:**
1. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior
2. **Build component**: Implement functionality
3. **Unit testing**: Isolated component validation
4. **Integration testing**: Component interaction
5. **User acceptance**: Does it solve the problem?

### **Before Each Release:**
1. **Regression testing**: All previous features still work
2. **Performance testing**: Acceptable speed for 633 players
3. **Data accuracy**: Spot-check against live Fantrax
4. **End-to-end validation**: Complete workflow test

### **Weekly Validation (In Season):**
1. **Recommendation accuracy**: Did our picks perform well?
2. **Data freshness**: Are we getting latest player updates?
3. **Algorithm tuning**: Adjust based on real results

## ⚠️ **Red Flags & Blockers**

### **Stop Development If:**
- 🚨 **Data accuracy below 95%**: Core reliability compromised
- 🚨 **Performance > 30 seconds**: User experience unacceptable  
- 🚨 **Critical bugs in constraints**: Could generate invalid lineups
- 🚨 **API access issues**: Can't fetch player data

### **Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Recommendations consistently poor vs alternatives
- ⚠️ High variance in results across runs
- ⚠️ User workflow too complex or time-consuming
- ⚠️ Feature scope expanding beyond documentation
