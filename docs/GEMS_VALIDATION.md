**Created**: August 14, 2025  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è OUTDATED - Now using flexible candidate ranking system (8 GK, 20 DEF, 20 MID, 20 FWD)
**Purpose**: Historical reference for manual validation process

**New Approach**: Candidate pools with PPM analysis for substitute/rotation upside identification

## üö® **Current System Limitations**

Our gems finder currently only looks at:
- Fantasy points vs salary (value ratio)
- Ownership percentage (<40% = differential)
- Basic position filtering

**Missing Critical Factors:**
- ‚ùå Minutes played per game
- ‚ùå Starting XI vs substitute role  
- ‚ùå Recent injury history
- ‚ùå Manager preference/rotation risk
- ‚ùå Recent form vs season total

        'injury_status': check_injury_reports(player),
        'starting_frequency': calculate_starts_vs_subs(player),
        'recent_form': get_last_5_games(player)
    }
    return risk_assessment(checks)
```

**Remember**: Better to miss a gem than pick an injured/benched player!  
**Manual validation takes 2 minutes per player but could save your entire Game Week.**
