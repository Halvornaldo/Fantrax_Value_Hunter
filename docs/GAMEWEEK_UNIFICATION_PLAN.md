# Gameweek Unification Implementation Plan
## Fantasy Football Value Hunter - Unified Gameweek Management System

### **Project Status: Critical Infrastructure Upgrade**

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to implement unified gameweek management across the entire Fantasy Football Value Hunter system, eliminating inconsistencies and preventing data loss.

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Priority**: High (Data Protection Critical)

---

## **Executive Summary**

### **Current Problem**
The codebase has **inconsistent gameweek detection** across 50+ functions using 4 different methods:
- Database MAX detection (dynamic but inconsistent between tables)
- Hardcoded defaults to gameweek=1 (static, becomes outdated)
- Manual user input (dangerous, enables accidental overwrites)
- Different table sources (player_metrics vs raw_player_snapshots)

### **Business Impact**
- **Data Loss Risk**: GW1 trend analysis data at risk when GW2 uploads begin
- **User Confusion**: Dashboard shows outdated GW1 data instead of current data after new uploads
- **Operational Risk**: Functions may overwrite historical data accidentally
- **Analytics Integrity**: Main dashboard should always show latest data for upcoming games

### **Solution**
Implement **GameweekManager** as single source of truth with:
- Unified gameweek detection for data imports and integrity
- Data protection preventing accidental overwrites  
- Automatic backup before any overwrite operations
- Main dashboard always displays current/latest data
- Historical analysis handled by separate trend analysis system

---

## **Pre-Implementation Analysis**

### **Codebase Audit Results**

#### **Functions Using Hardcoded Gameweek=1** (High Priority)
1. `/api/players` (src/app.py:402) - **CRITICAL**: Main dashboard data
2. `/api/export` (src/app.py:1188) - CSV exports stuck in GW1
3. `/api/import-lineups` (src/app.py:1062) - **DANGEROUS**: Overwrites GW1 lineup data
4. `/api/calculate-values-v2` (src/app.py:3128) - Parameter testing on wrong GW
5. `recalculate_true_values` (src/app.py:249) - Default recalculation function

#### **Functions Using Database MAX Detection** (Medium Priority)
1. `calculation_engine_v2.py:438` - V2.0 Enhanced Formula engine
2. `src/app.py:728` - Manual override functionality
3. Multiple trend analysis functions - Using different table sources

#### **Functions With Manual Input** (High Risk)
1. `/api/import-form-data` (src/app.py:1646) - **CRITICAL**: Form upload with user input
2. `/api/import-odds` (src/app.py:1844) - Odds import
3. Various validation endpoints - Manual gameweek specification

#### **Legacy Hardcoded References** (Cleanup Required)
1. Multiple validation scripts using `WHERE gameweek = 1`
2. Test scripts with hardcoded gameweek assumptions
3. Migration scripts with static gameweek references

---

## **Sprint-Based Implementation Plan**

### **Sprint 0: Emergency Protection & Analysis (3 days)**

#### **Objectives**
- Implement immediate GW1 data protection

           'error': 'GW1 data is protected during system upgrade. Contact admin if overwrite needed.'
       }), 400
   ```
   - Create manual backup of current GW1 data using:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE player_metrics_gw1_backup AS SELECT * FROM player_metrics WHERE gameweek = 1;
   CREATE TABLE raw_player_snapshots_gw1_backup AS SELECT * FROM raw_player_snapshots WHERE gameweek = 1;
