# Fantrax Value Hunter - Future Ideas & Deferred Features
**Post-v1.0 Enhancement Backlog**

This document contains all features that were considered during v1.0 planning but deliberately moved out of scope to maintain focus on the core parameter tuning dashboard.

**Version 1.0 Focus**: Parameter adjustment controls for value discovery across all 633 players

---

## üöÄ **High Priority Post-v1.0 Features**

### **Automatic Lineup Generation**
**Description**: AI-powered lineup optimization that automatically selects the best 11 players within budget constraints.

**Why Deferred**: Complex optimization logic could delay core parameter tuning functionality. Users prefer manual control for v1.0.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Linear programming solver for budget optimization
- Position constraint handling (1 GK, 3-5 DEF, 3-5 MID, 1-3 FWD)
- Multiple lineup variations for different strategies
- Integration with existing True Value calculations

### **Drag-and-Drop Lineup Builder**
**Description**: Interactive formation diagram where users can drag players into specific positions.

**Why Deferred**: Complex UI development would significantly extend v1.0 timeline. Parameter tuning is higher priority.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Interactive 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 3-5-2 formation templates
- Visual budget tracking as players are added
- Position validation and constraint warnings
- Direct export to Fantrax-compatible format

### **Real-time Web Scraping (Playwright MCP)**
**Description**: Live data feeds from Fantasy Football Scout, RotoWire, and injury sites.

**Why Deferred**: External dependencies and reliability concerns. v1.0 uses CSV import for controlled data input.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Playwright MCP integration for automated scraping
- Multiple source validation and conflict resolution  
- Injury status monitoring and alert system
- Live price change tracking

## üîí **Scope Protection Notes**

### **Feature Request Handling**
When new feature requests arise during v1.0 development:
1. **Document in this file** rather than implementing immediately
2. **Assess impact** on core parameter tuning functionality
3. **Defer by default** unless critical for v1.0 success
4. **User feedback** will prioritize post-v1.0 roadmap

### **Technical Debt Management**
- **Quick fixes** that don't impact core functionality: acceptable
- **Architectural changes** that delay v1.0: defer to future releases
- **Performance optimizations** beyond 633 player handling: defer
- **Code refactoring** for maintainability: evaluate case by case
