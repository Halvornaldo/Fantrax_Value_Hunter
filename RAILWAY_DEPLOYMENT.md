# Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

✅ **Completed Setup:**
- Flask app configured for production (environment variables)
- PostgreSQL database exported (fantrax_backup.sql - 7.4MB)
- Requirements.txt updated with production dependencies
- Procfile created for Railway

## Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Account
- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Sign up with GitHub account
- Connect your GitHub repository

### 2. Deploy Application
```bash
# Push latest changes to GitHub
git push origin master

# Or deploy directly via Railway CLI:
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In Railway dashboard, click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Railway will create database and provide `DATABASE_URL`
3. No additional configuration needed - app will auto-detect

### 4. Import Database
1. Connect to Railway PostgreSQL:
```bash
# Get connection details from Railway dashboard
railway connect postgresql
```

2. Import your data:
```bash
# Upload fantrax_backup.sql to Railway
cat fantrax_backup.sql | railway run psql $DATABASE_URL
```

### 5. Environment Variables
Railway automatically provides:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT` - Application port (auto-configured)

Optional variables to set:
- `FLASK_ENV=production`

### 6. Deploy from GitHub
1. Connect repository: github.com/[your-username]/Fantrax_Value_Hunter
2. Railway auto-detects Flask app and deploys
3. Custom domain available on paid plans

## Expected Costs

**Free Tier:**
- $0/month for hobby projects
- 512MB RAM, shared CPU
- 1GB storage
- Perfect for sharing with friends

**Hobby Plan:**
- $5/month
- Better performance and uptime
- Custom domains

## Post-Deployment

### Verify Deployment
1. Check Railway logs for startup messages
2. Test API endpoints: `/api/players`, `/api/config`
3. Verify database connection: should show "633 players loaded"

### Share with Friends
- Railway provides public URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`
- Dashboard fully functional with all features
- Real-time parameter adjustments work
- Complete Fantasy Football analysis tool

## Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Check DATABASE_URL in Railway environment
- Verify fantrax_backup.sql import completed
- Check logs for PostgreSQL connection errors

**Import Errors:**
- Ensure all dependencies in requirements.txt
- Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)
- Verify static file serving
