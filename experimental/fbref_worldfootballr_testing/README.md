# FBRef Data via worldfootballR - Experimental Testing

## Overview
Alternative approach to accessing football data by scraping FBRef directly using the worldfootballR R package, bypassing the currently down FBR API.

## Current Status: FBRef Scraping Blocked

**FBR API Status**: üî¥ Still down (500 errors)  
**worldfootballR Status**: üî¥ Blocked by FBRef (HTTP 403)  
**R Installation**: ‚úÖ Complete (R 4.5.1)  
**Package Installation**: ‚úÖ worldfootballR v0.6.8 installed

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- R 4.5.1 installed via winget
- Internet connection for package installation and data scraping

### Installation
```bash
# Run from this directory
"/c/Program Files/R/R-4.5.1/bin/R.exe" --file=setup_worldfootballr.R
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test Premier League data extraction
"/c/Program Files/R/R-4.5.1/bin/R.exe" --file=premier_league_test.R
```

## worldfootballR Capabilities

### Data Types Available
- **Match Results**: Historical and current season results
- **League Tables**: Standings and team statistics  
- **Team Stats**: Detailed team performance metrics
- **Player Stats**: Individual player statistics
- **Advanced Stats**: Expected goals, passing, shooting, etc.

### Key Functions
- `fb_match_results()` - Match results and scores
- `fb_league_stats()` - League tables and team stats
- `fb_player_season_stats()` - Player performance data
- `fb_team_match_stats()` - Detailed team statistics

### Supported Leagues
- Premier League (ENG-1st)
- La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1
- Championship, League One, League Two
- MLS, Liga MX, and many more

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct R Integration
- Use worldfootballR directly for data extraction
- Export to JSON/CSV for Python consumption
- Create scheduled R scripts for data updates

### Phase 2: Python Bridge
- Use `rpy2` to call R functions from Python
- Maintain existing Python architecture
- Add worldfootballR as alternative data source

### Phase 3: Hybrid Approach
- Primary: worldfootballR (reliable, comprehensive)
- Fallback: FBR API (when available)
- Cache data locally to reduce scraping load

## Advantages over FBR API

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Reliable**: Direct scraping from FBRef (stable source)
- **Comprehensive**: More data types and leagues
- **Free**: No API key or rate limits
- **Active**: Well-maintained R package
- **Flexible**: Can access historical data easily

### ‚ùå Current Issues
- **FBRef Blocking**: HTTP 403 Forbidden errors on all requests
- **Anti-Scraping**: FBRef has implemented stricter bot detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Immediate blocking without gradual throttling

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
- **Scraping**: Dependent on FBRef website structure
- **Rate Limiting**: Need to be respectful of FBRef servers
- **R Dependency**: Requires R environment
- **Learning Curve**: Different syntax from REST API

## Files

- `setup_worldfootballr.R` - Package installation and setup
- `install_packages.R` - Fixed package installation with user library
- `premier_league_test.R` - Premier League data extraction test
- `test_basic_functions.R` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_simple.R` - Simplified API tests
- `test_with_headers.R` - Anti-detection with custom headers
- `test_proxy_approach.R` - Advanced circumvention techniques
- `working_example.R` - Historical data access attempts
- `sample_*.json` - Sample data exports for integration

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
- R 4.5.1 installation via winget
- worldfootballR v0.6.8 package installation to user library
- All dependencies (httr, rvest, dplyr, etc.) installed successfully
- Basic FBRef website accessibility confirmed (base URLs return 200)
- Brief success with 2021-22 Premier League data (380 matches retrieved once)

### ‚ùå Failed Tests
- `fb_match_results()` - Consistent HTTP 403 Forbidden errors
- All current/recent season data extraction blocked (2024, 2025)
- Historical season access blocked after initial success (2019-2022)
- Anti-detection techniques ineffective

## Anti-Detection Analysis

### üîç Techniques Tested
1. **Custom User-Agent Headers** - Failed (403)
2. **Browser-Like Headers** (Accept, Accept-Language, etc.) - Failed (403)
3. **Session Persistence** - Failed (403)  
4. **Extended Delays** (10+ seconds) - Failed (403)
5. **Different Endpoints** - Main site accessible, data endpoints blocked
6. **R Session Configuration** - Temporarily successful, then blocked
7. **Historical Data Access** - Brief success (380 matches), then blocked

### üõ°Ô∏è FBRef Protection Analysis
- **Sophisticated Anti-Bot System**: Dynamic, adaptive protection
- **Selective Blocking**: Main website loads fine, data endpoints protected
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Success followed by immediate re-blocking
- **Not IP-Based**: Base site accessible, specific endpoints blocked
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from repeated access attempts

### üìä Key Findings
- **Current IP**: 84.236.65.179 (not banned)
- **Base FBRef URLs**: All return HTTP 200 status
- **Data Endpoints**: Consistently return HTTP 403 Forbidden
- **Cloudflare Protection**: Server headers show Cloudflare security
- **Dynamic Blocking**: Protection adapts to circumvention attempts

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Advanced Circumvention (Proceed with Caution)
- **Residential Proxy Services** - Rotating residential IPs
- **Browser Automation** - Selenium with real browser sessions
- **Distributed Scraping** - Multiple IPs/locations  
- **Extended Request Spacing** - Hours between requests
- **VPN with Geographic Rotation** - Different locations

### Option 2: Alternative Data Sources
- **Football Data API** (football-data.org) - Free tier available
- **OpenFootball** (open data project) - Historical data
- **Sportradar API** (premium service) - Comprehensive coverage
- **RapidAPI Football** endpoints - Multiple providers
- **API-Sports Football** - Real-time and historical data

### Option 3: Wait for Recovery
- **FBR API Recovery** - Most reliable long-term solution
- **FBRef Policy Changes** - Anti-bot measures may relax
- **worldfootballR Updates** - Package may adapt to blocking

## Ethical Considerations

‚öñÔ∏è **Important Notes on Circumvention**:
- Respect FBRef's bandwidth and server resources
- Review and comply with FBRef's terms of service  
- Consider reaching out to FBRef for official API access
- Avoid aggressive techniques that could harm their service
- Use circumvention only for legitimate research/analysis

## Conclusions

### ‚ùå **worldfootballR/FBRef Route**: Currently Not Viable
- Sophisticated, adaptive anti-bot protection
- Multiple circumvention techniques failed
- Brief success followed by rapid re-blocking
- Risk of permanent IP blocking with aggressive attempts

### ‚úÖ **Recommendations**:
1. **Wait for FBR API recovery** (most reliable)
2. **Evaluate alternative football data APIs**
3. **Use historical data sources where available**
4. **Consider multiple data source approach**

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Install R and worldfootballR
2. ‚úÖ Test Premier League data extraction (blocked)
3. ‚úÖ Test anti-detection techniques (failed)
4. üîÑ Research alternative football data APIs
5. ‚è≥ Evaluate Football Data API free tier
6. ‚è≥ Compare data coverage across sources
7. ‚è≥ Implement hybrid data collection approach
